- 🐣 Hi, I’m Felipe Candal Campos, I'm working at [La Nación](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/) as a React front end developer.
Currently, my main focus is at developing highly scalable apps, from the ground up, using best practices
(guidelines, for ex), and new technologies. <br /> <br />

- ☕️ I’m interested in research and disruptive technologies. <br /><br />

- 🌱 Aside my main job, I'm currently migrating a PHP MVC based system (my own MVC variation) to a
React app that relies on a GraphQL server.
This server is being developed using GraphQL | MongoDB | GO (Golang).
I'm also building a Design System (Tokens + Components), and had already connected to the Figma API to extract them.
