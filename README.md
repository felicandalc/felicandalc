- 🐣 Hi, I’m Felipe Candal Campos, I'm working at La Nación (BGlobalSolutions) as a React front end developer.
My currently main focus is at developing highly scalable apps, from the ground up, using best practices
(guidelines, for ex), and new technologies. <br /> <br />

- ☕️ I’m interested in research and disruptive technologies. <br /><br />

- 🌱 Aside my main job, I'm currently migrating a PHP MVC based system (my own MVC variation) to a
Solid app (JS framework similar to React without virtual DOM) that uses microservices.
This microservices are being developed using GraphQL (+ Shield for permissions) | MongoDB | GO (Golang).
I'm also building a Design System (Tokens + Components), and had already connect to the Figma API to extract them.
